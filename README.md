[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/blind-oracle/psql-streamer/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/blind-oracle/psql-streamer?branch=master)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/blind-oracle/psql-streamer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/blind-oracle/psql-streamer)

This service receives the database events from PostgreSQL using logical replication protocol and feeds them to sinks based on the configuration file settings.
Also can receive the events from Kafka generated by e.g. another _psql-streamer_ instance.

## Event example

```json
{
  "Host": "db1",
  "Database": "test",
  "Table": "test",
  "Action": "insert",
  "WALPosition": 418152976,
  "Timestamp": "2018-07-03T16:04:27.263625156+02:00",
  "Columns": {
    "a": 369223,
    "b": "a"
  }
}
```

## Features

- You can configure a sink to receive events from several different sources (e.g. several Kafka clusters, PostgreSQL databases)
- Basic HTTP API
- Custom sources/sinks can be easily added - they only need to implement a simple interface
- **Requires PostgreSQL 10+** (although initial implementation of logical replication came in 9.4 it lacks certain features to be useful)

## Sources

### PostgreSQL

Receive database events from PostgreSQL using logical replication protocol and transform them into a common event format.

#### Features

- **WAL log position persistence**: the service persists each log position update it receives in a BoltDB database.

- **Configurable WAL logs retention** on the PostgreSQL side. To allow us to rewind back (in case we need to replay some events) the service implements delayed confirmation of applied logs. This makes PostgreSQL retain the logs for the specified replication slot for some time. See _walRetain_ parameter in the configuration file.

#### PostgreSQL configuration

- In `postgresql.conf` you need to set `wal_level = logical` to make logical replication possible. You also may need to adjust `max_wal_senders` and `max_replication_slots` to match your requirements.
- Create a publication in PostgreSQL like this: `CREATE PUBLICATION pub1 FOR ALL TABLES`. This will include in the publication all existing tables and also the ones that will be created in future. If you want only a subset of tables to be replicated - list them specifically. See [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/sql-createpublication.html) for details.
- Specify the publication name in the _psql-streamer.conf_

### Kafka

Receive events which were generated by e.g. another **psql-streamer** instance from one or more Kafka topics. Expects messages in a JSON format conforming to a predefined structure (see _Event structure_ below).

#### Features

Kafka source works in batching mode with confirmation: if all events in a batch from Kafka are ACKed by sinks then we commit the whole batch or don't commit anything. The batch elements are sent concurrently using goroutines, so it should not be made very large. If several topics are specified then they're worked on in separate goroutines which should provide more parallelism.

## Sinks

### Kafka

Send events into a Kafka topic based on several configurable rules like:

- Table -> Topic mapping
- Fallback topic messages with no mapping defined

#### Kafka sink handlers

Incoming events are processed by one or more handlers that generate Kafka messages. They can be used to enrich Events with additional data or encode them in different format.

Currently there's only one handler:

- **passthrough**: simply marshal an event into JSON and send it to Kafka

### Stub

Stub sink is a discard/noop sink that can be used for testing.

## HTTP API

All requests are GET.

- **/health** is a no-op that just returns 200
- **/status** checks all sinks/sources statuses and outputs them. If something is not OK then it returns 500 instead of 200. Useful for monitoring.
- **/stats** returns statistics from all sinks/sources
- **/debug/[on|off]** toggles debugging mode for all sinks/sources
- **/metrics** gives out Prometheus metrics

## Configuration

See [psql-streamer.toml](https://github.com/blind-oracle/psql-streamer/blob/master/psql-streamer.toml) for detailed instructions.

## Download

Get RPM or DEB packages from [Releases](https://github.com/blind-oracle/psql-streamer/releases) page

## Build

**psql-streamer** is written in [Go](https://golang.org), so you need to install it first.

Then you can run `make build` to build a binary.

If you want to build RPM/DEB packages then you need to install [FPM](https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm) and then run `make rpm` or `make deb`
